// Input & Output - Automated System Greeting for New Users
// Imagine a software system that welcomes new users as soon as they register or log in for the first time. 
// The system automatically greets the user by displaying "Hello, World!" as soon as the application starts, 
// without waiting for any input. The greeting message helps make the system feel welcoming and interactive.

// In this scenario, the system is designed to immediately greet users with the message "Hello, World!" when they access the software for the first time. 
// This behaviour mimics a system that performs an action (like sending a welcome email or showing a message) right after a user logs in. 
// Thereâ€™s no need for any input from the user; the system automatically prints the greeting when launched.

// Sample Output Hello, World!
